## about

This is the repo for otto competiton.

## goal

We want top 10% ~~and money~~!

## use

Python! Forget about fucking R... `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost` and `nolearn` should be everything!

## coding style
* **wrap the process into functions** so that we could import everything and do not mess up everything
* use **four spaces** indention in Python code instead of tab and two spaces (VERY important!)
* divide the codes into blocks, global, data preproccessing, build model, predict, etc.
* always add comments to what is unclear, using lower case letters.
* always use variables in `this_is_a_variable` instead of `thisIsAVariable`, unless it is defined by the packages, etc.
* 

## warning
* when the bugs occur, check whether we clean the `*.pyc* files and restart iPython again.

## git usage
* the files committed to gitlab should always be runnable.
* deal with the conflicts, if any occurs.
